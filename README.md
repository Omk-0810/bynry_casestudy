#Case study app for Bynry

This case study is based on flutter. I have use the firebase as the backend. The app includes the functionality of registration module which consist of signup,siginand forget password.

The new feature added in the app is "chat bot" to which you can ask questions about using the app,also you can ask safety tips ,and how to save resources.To use the chatbot click on the floating button in the dashboard and for the chatbot I have only added the basic questions we can also add as many questions and answers as we want.

As there was no codebase provided to work with I tried to build the user interface same as given in the case study.

I have used BloC state management for this casestudy.
